<!-- Data exploration --->
# What do I have in the data set "unemployment"? {-}

First, I loaded the data set. Then I explored each variable and drew a first road map of the next steps. First,  I renamed some variables because their names are formed by two words separated by blank space. I replaced the blank space by "_". The data set contains data from 2013 to 2017. We want only 2017, so I kept only data for year equal to 2017. "NA" values were present and coded as "No consta". I renamed "No consta" to "NA" values. The data contained number of unemployed people per gender. I created a unique value per district-neighborhood-month. In consequence, I removed gender. As last step, I kept only the variables of interest. The last step consists on detecting duplicated cases. The result showed that there were no duplicated cases. 

From the 888 observation, only 870 has no one NA on any of its rows. There are 18 cases for which district code, district name, neighborhood code & neighborhood name are all NA. Therefore, I removed the rows with NA. 

```{r}

# Visualization

There is no visible trend in the data. The median value is similar
during the year. However, there is visible difference in the dispercion 
of the data. 
```{r}
# add level for the month variable
level <- c(
  "January",
  "February",
  "March",
  "April",
  "May",
  "June",
  "July",
  "August",
  "September",
  "October",
  "November",
  "December"
)

# parse Month into factor: ----
unemployment.2017 <-
  unemployment.2017[, 
                    Month := parse_factor(Month, levels = 
                                            level)]

# boxplot unemployment per month ----
plot((unemployment.2017$Month), unemployment.2017$unemployment)
```

In general, there are neighborhood with persistent unemployment. 

```{r}
unemployment.2017 %>% 
  ggplot(aes(as.factor(unemployment.2017$Neighborhood_Name),
     unemployment.2017$unemployment)
     ) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(Month))

# unemployment: violin

unemployment.2017 %>%
  ggplot(
    aes(unemployment.2017$Month,
        unemployment.2017$unemployment)
  ) +
  geom_violin()
```
